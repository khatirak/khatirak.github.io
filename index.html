        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! My name is Khatira, and welcome to my website. Here I want to show my coding progress, personal interests, and university experience.
        </p>
        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>
            I created this website primarily to document my learning journey. Honestly, I wanted to document my coding experience because
            I have just finished my second year of university, but I feel lost in my degree and am not sure what I want to specialize in. 
            Many of my peers are conducting research in their areas of interest or doing internships in analysis or software engineering. 
            I still have no idea how to use my coding experience in a practical field, which is another reason why I created this website. 
            By building this website, I have already learned skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I hope to develop these skills further. 
            On my <a href="kode.html">Kode</a> page, I will list the skills I want to develop and try to document my experience as much as possible.
        </p>
        <h2>Future Plans</h2>
        <p>
            I am still not 100% set on what I want to do with my career in computer science, but I know I am interested
            in the field of cybersecurity and I regret not taking more active steps in this direction. I really want to go
            over some tutorials and classes to go over the basics and foundations of the field and build up my skills from there. 
            I also want to possibly delve into the world of software engineering, I enjoy coding and trying to solve problems naturually so 
            it would definitley be a possible career path I am interested in. 
        </p>
